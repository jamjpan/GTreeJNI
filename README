The gtree.h/gtree.cc here has been modified so that it can be transformed by
SWIG. The mutex was taken out, and the cmp member of Matrix was moved out of
Matrix and copied into the methods where it was used to work around SWIGging
the () operator.

To use the SWIG-ified gtree, Java needs the "proxy" classes in jni-bridge
and the C++ library, libgtree.so. Check the Makefile for how to build these
classes and the library.

In run.sh, you will find the flag -Djava.library.path=.  This indicates to the
JVM to look in the current location for any libraries. The "System.loadLibrary"
call in app.java declares which library to load.

You will also find -cp.:jni-bridge, indicating to look in jni-bridge/ folder
for external classes. This flag lets the JVM be able to find the proxy classes.

The global methods in gtree.cc (e.g. load, get) can be accessed by using the
module name. For example, line 15 of app.java calls gtree.load to call the
global load method.
