This directory contains the SWIG interface file and Makefile commands to build
Java classes and native binary that wrap and provide libgtree functionality. A
header-only version of the libgtree library is provided in cc/ directory. For
the author version see https://github.com/wangyong01/GTree

To build the binary library, type `make lib`. To build the Java classes as a
Java archive (jar), type `make jar`. To build everything, type `make`. You
need to have METIS installed in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the build to succeed.

These commands were tested against Java 11.0.01 and SWIG Version 4.0.1 on
Fedora 27, see http://www.swig.org for more information.
