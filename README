The gtree.h/gtree.cc here has been modified so that it can be transformed by
SWIG. The mutex was taken out, and the cmp member of Matrix was moved out of
Matrix and copied into the methods where it was used to work around SWIGging
the () operator.

To use the SWIG-ified gtree, Java needs the "proxy" classes in
`cn/edu/tsinghua/cs/dbgroup/gtreeJNI` and the C++ library, libgtree.so. Check
the Makefile for how to build these classes and the library.

In run.sh, you will find the flag -Djava.library.path=.  This indicates to the
JVM to look in the current location for any libraries. The "System.loadLibrary"
call in app.java declares which library to load.

The global methods in gtree.cc (e.g. load, get) can be accessed by using the
module name. For example, line 17 of app.java calls gtreeJNI.load to call the
global load method.
